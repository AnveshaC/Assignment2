## ✅ Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

### 🔹 Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.

  # Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

## Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2. Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3. Displays the final sum.

## Solution
The program uses a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers 1 to 50, adds each number to a cumulative sum variable, and finally prints the total sum.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Run the script using Python 3:
