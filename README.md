## âœ… Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

### ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

### ðŸ“¥ Input:
- Integer value entered by the user.

### ðŸ“¤ Output:
- Displays whether the entered number is even or odd.


  # Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

## Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2. Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3. Displays the final sum.

## Solution
The program uses a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers 1 to 50, adds each number to a cumulative sum variable, and finally prints the total sum.
